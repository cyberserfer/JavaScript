  ## Loops
  For - good when you can determine how many times the loop will need to run.
  
  Do While - will run at least once before the condition is evaluated.
  
  While - evaluates the condition before executing anything.
  
  ```
  var i = 0;
  
  do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
  } while (i <= 10);
  
  while(i <= 10){
    console.log(i);
    i++;
  }
  ```
  ## Functions
  
  funtions will return "undefined" unless there is an explicit ***return****.
